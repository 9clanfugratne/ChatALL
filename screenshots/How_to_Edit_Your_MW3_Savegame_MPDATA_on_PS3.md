`  `
## How to Improve Your MW3 Skills
` `
Besides editing your savegame MPDATA file, there are other ways to improve your MW3 skills and enjoy the game more. Here are some tips and tricks that might help you become a better player:
` `
`
`- Hip fire. It's more accurate than you think, especially with steady aim. Of course, we don't recommend this for every engagement, but it saves a lot of time in close quarter engagements when aiming down sight isn't needed[^3^].
`
`- Vary your strategy between rushing enemies and camping. If you rush enemies without firepower, you won't last long at all. You can last many rounds without buying weapons if you stick to scavenging enemy weapons[^1^].
`
`- Use proper class setups. Depending on your playstyle and game mode, you might want to choose different weapons, perks, attachments and killstreaks. For example, if you play Domination, you might want to use a class with Hardline Pro, Blast Shield Pro and Sitrep Pro to capture and defend flags more effectively[^2^].
`
`- Flash the juggernauts. They stop shooting for a good 5 seconds, giving you enough time to take them down or run away. You can also use care packages to kill them if you can get them to stay still long enough[^1^].
`
`- Use exploits and glitches at your own risk. There are some spots on some maps that can give you an unfair advantage over your enemies, such as the plane glitch on Outpost[^1^]. However, using these exploits and glitches may violate the terms of service of MW3 and PSN and may result in a ban or suspension from online play. Use them at your own discretion and only for educational purposes.
