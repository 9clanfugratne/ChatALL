If you own a Wyse S10 device, you may want to update its firmware to the latest version, which is 6.5. Firmware 6.5 offers improved performance, security and compatibility with various protocols and servers.
 
However, downloading and installing Wyse S10 firmware 6.5 is not a straightforward process. You need to have a valid subscription to the Software Maintenance program from Dell, which owns Wyse. You also need to use a specific method to flash the firmware image to your device.
 
In this article, we will guide you through the steps to download Wyse S10 firmware 6.5 and update your device successfully.
  
## Step 1: Get a Software Maintenance subscription
 
According to Dell's support forum[^1^], firmware for Wyse ThinOS is not free and requires that you subscribe to the Software Maintenance program for all your clients. This applies for thin clients currently in production. If your device is EOL (S10, R10L, etc.) then no further upgrades are available.
 
To enroll in the Software Maintenance program, you need to visit the following URL: http://www.wyse.com/products/software/os/index.asp for more information or you can contact Dell's Inside Sales department at (800) 438-9973 option 1.
 
Once you have a valid subscription, you can access the Self-Service Center at https://support.wyse.com/OA\_HTML/ibuhpage.jsp where you can download the latest firmware image for your device.
  
## Step 2: Download the firmware image
 
After logging in to the Self-Service Center, you need to search for the firmware image for your device. The filename should be something like WTOS\_6\_5\_0\_32.bin or WTOS\_6\_5\_0\_32.zip. You can also use the product code or serial number of your device to find the correct image.
 
Download the firmware image to your computer and extract it if it is compressed. You should have a file with a .bin extension, which is the actual firmware image that you need to flash to your device.
  
## Step 3: Flash the firmware image
 
There are two methods to flash the firmware image to your device: using a USB stick or using an FTP server. We will explain both methods below.
  
### Method 1: Using a USB stick
 
This method requires that you have a USB stick with at least 256 MB of free space and formatted as FAT32. You also need to download and install the USB Firmware Tool from Dell's website: https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=9j8r9
 
Follow these steps to flash the firmware image using a USB stick:
 
1. Run the USB Firmware Tool and select your USB stick as the target device.
2. Select "Create Bootable USB Drive" and click "Next".
3. Select "Wyse ThinOS" as the product family and click "Next".
4. Select "Wyse S10" as the product model and click "Next".
5. Browse to the location of the firmware image file (.bin) that you downloaded earlier and click "Next".
6. Click "Start" to create the bootable USB drive with the firmware image.
7. When the process is complete, eject the USB stick safely from your computer.
8. Plug the USB stick into your Wyse S10 device and turn it on.
9. The device will boot from the USB stick and start flashing the firmware image automatically.
10. Wait until the process is finished and do not turn off or unplug the device during this time.
11. When the process is done, remove the USB stick and reboot the device.
12. Your Wyse S10 device should now be running firmware 6.5.
